The game consists of a character controlled by the player and his task is to exterminate all the threats in the different scenarios of the map.
In order to eliminate the threats he must arm himself with more than just his courage to survive. The player must collect the weapons placed on the stage in order to accomplish his mission.
The character has infinite ammunition, but will only be able to fire a number of bullets depending on the weapon, which can be reloaded to continue his mission.

Weapons will appear lying on the ground in one of the scenarios, not necessarily randomly. The player will initially have to sneak to be able to pick up the weapon to start eliminating enemies.
6. The player can shoot towards the position the player clicks, so the bullets can have trajectories at different angles according to the player's position and the position where the player clicked. The number of bullets you can shoot must be a limited number. After spending all the bullets, you must reload. The ammunition of each weapon is unlimited.
